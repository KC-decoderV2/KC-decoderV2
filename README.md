- I’m @KC-decoderV2
- I’m interested in Machine Learning and Parallel Programming algorithms that leverage the power of GPUs for fast,efficient computing
- I’m currently learning Parallel Programming on Nvidia GPUs using CUDA, at CERN
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps me get closer to Parallel Programming techniques.
